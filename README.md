# Data Modeling with PostgreSQL and ETL implementation in Python
A startup named Sparkify wants to analyze user activities using their song and user data. The current data is spread among several JSON files, making it hard to query and analyze.

This project aims to create an ETL pipeline to load song and user data to a Postgres database, making it easier to query and analyze data.
